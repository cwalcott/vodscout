# Decisions Log

Dated, one-line-ish entries for specific decisions made while building —
thresholds, UX choices, things tried and reverted. Architecture-level
decisions belong in `SPEC.md`; this file is for the smaller stuff that's
easy to forget the reasoning for.

Format:

- Used tomlkit instead of tomllib + tomli-w: single dep, preserves user comments/formatting when writing back to config.
- Added Rich for terminal output: analyzer report and watched interactive session will need it; easier to add now than retrofit.
- Skipped pydantic: config is shallow (flat keys + per-streamer emote dicts), a dataclass is sufficient.
- Skipped mypy: solo side project, annotation friction not worth the bug-catch benefit at this scale.
- Dev tooling: uv for venv/install workflow, ruff for lint+format (replaces black/isort/flake8).
